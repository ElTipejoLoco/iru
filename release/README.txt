...they're here! (...iru!) English Translation Release v1.0 (July 2021)
###################################################################

## Intro ##
You and a few classmates stay late at the school to prepare for the culture 
festival tomorrow. Unknown to you, something far more sinister is underway.
Can you survive the horrors of your school and make it out alive?

..they're here! is more of a narrative puzzle game than a survival horror game.
The game mostly progresses from talking to people and using items. There are
times when enemies will attack you, but you can only run and hide.

This patch has been tested with a CD-R on a modded PS1 and completed without issues.


## Installation ##
* The patcher expects the BIN version of the game *
- If your copy has multiple tracks, you can delete track 2 since it's just
padding. Use track 1.bin for patching.
- Drag and drop the BIN file onto "Drag and drop BIN on me.bat".
- A .bin and a .cue file will be generated next to the patcher.
- Enjoy!

* If you're not on Windows but can run xdelta3, use the .xdelta3 file in the
"patch_data" folder on your BIN file to apply the patch. The "multitrack"
patch is for games that had a track 1 and a track 2. They're for different
rips of the game, so if one doesn't work, try the other. The patcher automatically
tries both if necessary.

## WARNING##
############
- I *highly* recommend saving after the lights go out early on. There's an event
shortly after that crashes occassionally on some emulators. This bug seems to be
present in the original game and is somewhat random, so just try again if it happens.
Console seems to handle it just fine.

## Tips ##
- We've included both translated maps and a spoiler-free walkthrough that you
may use to make your trip easier. The maps come directly from the game's
manual, so Japanese players had access to them while playing. I'd recommend
exploring the game on your own, then referencing the walkthrough if you get stuck.

- You need to use L2/R2 to look up and down. You'll need to look at items on the
floor this way to pick them up with circle. You can test this out with the crowbar
behind you in the first room.

- Use the notice boards to save now and then. There are a few events that will
kill you without warning, so be sure to save to avoid having to replay too much content.

- There are 2 routes through the game based on an early game decision. The guide
mentions this branching point, but I encourage you to see what happens on your
first run then try the other one after. If you watched my YouTube let's play
translation years ago, first: I'm sorry, second: I did route A and didn't realize
route B was a thing. So in that case, I'd recommend route B.

- There are 3 main endings to the game: true ending, normal ending, and a bad ending.
The bad ending is different for each route, so there's 4 endings to see in total.
Check the guide if you get stuck finding them!
